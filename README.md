# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

The purpose of this application is to analyze and address issues on the [Kings League](https://kingsleague.pro/) page using various techniques.

## Image Size

It is worth noticing that image size can have a huge impact on page performance. Optimizing the images is important to avoid long page load times.

On the official website, some images are larger than 100KB. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, in this case, these images can be optimized to significantly reduce their size.

The approach I took to reduce the load size of images is to use tools like [squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app/editor), [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/), and [SvgOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/).

For images **(.jpg)** that are loaded and exceed 70KB in size, I converted them into **.webp** format.

On the other hand, I reduced the size of all the **.svg** by using [SvgOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/).

In fact, the above section loads **320 KB** of images. With proper optimization, it can be reduced less than **120KB**, which is an incredible performance improvement.

### Serve WebP images

Even though WebP is a modern image format that provides superior lossless and lossy compression for web images, it is not supported by older browsers.

If your application needs to support older browsers, I encourage you to look at the following posts:
